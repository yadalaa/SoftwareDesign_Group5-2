Handling NoClassDefFoundError for JAXBException in Java 9

## source type

Blog 

## author

## date

December 13, 2019

## Problem

1. Upgrading to Java 9 may cause NoClassDefFoundError for certain classes like JAXBException, as they may not be available on the classpath by default.

2. Using the --add-modules command line argument for compatibility with multiple Java versions can lead to maintenance issues with multiple build files.

3. The --add-modules option is deprecated in future Java releases, necessitating an alternative solution to handle missing class issues.

## Solution

1. Implement robust exception handling to gracefully manage exceptions, provide meaningful error messages, and prevent application termination.

2. Utilize .NET framework's consistent exception handling across different programming languages for compatibility within the .NET ecosystem.

3. Use exceptions as a superior error notification method, avoiding the propagation of invalid values and ensuring program reliability.

## Decision Driver

Using Maven as a dependency management tool ensures a flexible and compatible long-term solution across Java versions without manual command line arguments or version considerations.

## Problem

1. Linux has a limited number of file descriptors, which might be insufficient for resource-intensive applications.

2. Collaborating with an experienced Linux sysadmin and conducting performance tests helps determine the optimal file descriptor limit based on the application's needs.

## Solution

1. Consider using a dependency management tool like Maven to manage project dependencies and ensure compatibility with optimized libraries.

2. Collaborate with a seasoned Linux sysadmin to assess system needs, conduct performance testing, and set the appropriate file descriptor limit based on the application's specific requirements and resource usage.

## Decision Driver

Optimize Linux file descriptor limits with Maven and a seasoned sysadmin's guidance based on your application's needs.

## Problem

1. Selecting the right error handling tool in C++ is challenging due to the absence of a perfect option and the need to await future improvements.

2. Error handling adds complexity and potential sources of incorrect behavior, making code less understandable, especially when developers prioritize the "happy path" of execution.

## Solution

1. Implement robust exception handling to handle exceptions gracefully, providing meaningful error messages and preventing application termination.

2. Utilize the .NET framework's consistent exception handling across various programming languages within the ecosystem.
   
3. Prefer exceptions over traditional return codes for superior error notification, enabling effective issue identification, and ensuring program reliability.

## Decision Driver

Promotes proactive error prevention over reactive handling, encouraging developers to adopt this approach in their team's practices.

How to Catch All Exceptions in C# & Find All Application Errors

## source type

## date

July 5, 2023

## Problem

1. Catching all exceptions can be challenging, leading to significant noise and data when logging, making it impractical for long-term use in production.

2. Exception handling in specific frameworks like ASP.NET, MVC, Web API, and WCF may differ, requiring understanding and configuration for each framework.

3. The article lacks comprehensive guidance on handling exceptions in various scenarios, including specific types of exceptions and best practices for different application contexts.

4. Subscribing to all exceptions and extensive logging can cause performance and application behavior issues, necessitating caution in enabling such practices in production applications.

## Solution

1. Enhance exception tracking and logging with comprehensive monitoring tools to gain better insights into exceptions and address issues effectively.

2. Invest time in understanding specific framework error handling mechanisms and leverage features like exception filters and handlers for robust handling strategies.

3. Design context-specific exception handling approaches based on application nature and expected exceptions, considering user experience and data integrity.

4. Balance exception logging with performance by implementing selective logging for critical scenarios, minimizing performance impact while gaining valuable insights.
 
## Decision Driver

Empower developers to enhance application reliability and stability by proficiently handling exceptions and reducing the impact of errors on end users.

Exception handling in WCF

## Problem

1. Handling exceptions in WCF is challenging due to constraints in sending serialized data and limited options for transmitting exception messages to service consumers.

2. WCF's default generic error messages lack detailed information, making it difficult for consumers to understand and resolve issues.

## Solution

1. Set includeExceptionDetailInFaults to true in the web.config or programmatically to include additional exception details in the fault message for easier debugging.

2. Use FaultException with specific error messages and custom fault classes marked with the DataContract attribute to provide user-friendly exception messages and more detailed fault information to consumers.
 
## Decision Driver

Effectively handle exceptions in WCF applications for proper error handling, enhanced debugging, and user-friendly exception messages to consumers.

## Problem

1. Lack of exception handling in SQL Server procedures makes identifying and resolving exceptions challenging.

2. Difficulty in identifying the cause of exceptions without proper logging or error detail capturing.

3. Inefficient debugging process without exception details, wasting time to locate the specific cause.

4. Limited visibility and understanding of exceptions in the database without a mechanism for logging and capturing errors.

## Solution

1. Implement try-catch blocks in SQL Server procedures for handling exceptions and performing necessary actions.

2. Create a dedicated error log table, like "DBErrorLogs," to store relevant exception information for logging and analysis.

3. Utilize predefined SQL functions, such as ERROR_NUMBER(), ERROR_STATE(), ERROR_SEVERITY(), ERROR_LINE(), ERROR_PROCEDURE(), ERROR_MESSAGE(), and GETDATE(), to capture specific exception details.

4. Improve debugging efficiency by referring to the error log table for identifying and resolving exceptions promptly.
 
## Decision Driver

The article focuses on enhancing exception handling in SQL Server, improving debugging, and empowering effective exception resolution by developers.

Blog 

## author 

Joel Hans

## date

Feb 16, 2022

## Problem

1. Large-scale software projects are inherently complex, making it impossible to anticipate and test for all user interactions, leading to bugs discovered post-release.

2. Relying solely on user error reporting through popups is ineffective, as users often do not submit error reports, hindering valuable feedback and confidence in the error reporting process.

## Solution

1. Architect for better error reporting with naming conventions, version info, and clear exception handling standards.
   
2. Utilize error monitoring platforms like Raygun's Crash Reporting for proactive tracking and centralized error logs, prioritizing critical issues and identifying trends post-deployment.
