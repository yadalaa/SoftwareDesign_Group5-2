# Problem02 : Exception Handling (S02, S04, S05, S06, S07, S19, S26, S29, S37)

### Solution 1:

- In the primary method, we divide 10 by 0, causing an exception. Using a try-catch block, we display "Error: Cannot divide by zero" (S02).

### Solution 2:

- We enclose the code "5 / 0" in a try block to handle the exception. If an exception occurs, the subsequent code in the try block is bypassed (S04).

### Solution 3:

- The program's flow control is transferred to the catch block, which prints a message indicating that the array does not contain four items. Execution then continues (S05).

### Solution 4:

- Create a user-defined Exception class that takes a parameter. When an exception of this class occurs, the handler should display "MyException[param]," where the param represents the passed parameter (S06).

### Solution 5:

- Exceptions help identify situations where one exception triggers another in an application. For example, a method throws an ArithmeticException due to an attempt to divide by zero. Still, the underlying cause of the exception is an I/O error that led to the divisor being zero (S07).

### Solution 6:

- Use FaultException to transmit user-friendly exception messages from the service to consumers. Create custom fault classes with the DataContract attribute for more specific fault information (S19).

### Solution7:

- Use exception handling to separate error-checking code from the main tasks of the program, improving clarity and modifiability (S26)

### Solution8:

- Catch blocks are used to handle specific types of exceptions (S29)

### Solution9:

- Ensure proper propagation of exceptions by catching and rethrowing them or handling them at appropriate levels (S37)

### Solution 10:

- Implement exception handling to handle unexpected events, ensuring program stability and uninterrupted operation (S14).

# Problem05 : Making Exception Handling Work (s23)

## Solution

Runtime-Level Exception Handling: Exception handling should become a platform-level issue, either at the runtime or operating system level. The execution environment should provide mechanisms for automatically handling and recovering from exceptions without explicit intervention from the programmer.

## Decision Driver

- The decision to shift exception handling to the platform level and introduce automatic recovery mechanisms is driven by the goal of improving software quality, increasing productivity, and reducing the burden on programmers. It is based on the recognition of flaws in the current approach and drawing parallels with successful memory management techniques.
