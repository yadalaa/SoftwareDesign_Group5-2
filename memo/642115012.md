## Problem

1. When upgrading to Java 9, some classes, such as JAXBException, may not be available on the classpath by default, leading to a NoClassDefFoundError.

2. Limited compatibility with multiple Java versions: Using the --add-modules command line argument to include the required module may not be a suitable solution for applications that need to run on multiple versions of Java, as it requires maintaining multiple sets of build files.

3. Deprecation of the --add-modules option: The --add-modules option is deprecated in future Java releases, which means it will eventually become obsolete, requiring a new solution to address the missing class issue.

## Solution

1. Implement robust exception handling in your code to gracefully handle exceptions and recover from them when possible. This can involve using try-catch blocks to catch specific exceptions and handle them appropriately, providing meaningful error messages, and taking appropriate actions to prevent application termination.

2. Utilize the exception handling mechanism provided by the .NET framework, which offers consistent exception throwing and handling across different programming languages. This allows each language to define its own syntax for handling exceptions while ensuring compatibility within the .NET ecosystem.

3. Use exceptions as a superior method of error notification compared to traditional approaches like return codes. By throwing exceptions, failures are not ignored, and the runtime terminates the application if exceptions are unhandled. This helps identify and address issues more effectively, preventing the propagation of invalid values and ensuring program reliability.

## Decision Driver

  This decision is driven by the need for a long-term solution that provides flexibility, compatibility across different Java versions, and resilience against future changes in Java releases. By using a dependency management tool like Maven, developers can effectively manage dependencies and ensure the required modules are available on the classpath without the need for manual command line arguments or specific Java version considerations.

## Problem

1. File Descriptor Limits: Linux imposes a hard limit on the number of file descriptors available to a process. The default limit may be insufficient for applications that access numerous system resources such as databases, network resources, or files.

2. Determining the Appropriate File Descriptor Limit: The article suggests that determining the appropriate file descriptor limit depends on various factors, including performance testing and monitoring the number of open file handles consumed by the processes. Collaborating with a seasoned Linux sysadmin is recommended to determine the optimal limit for the system.



## Solution

1. Using Dependency Management Tool: The article does not specifically mention a solution related to a dependency management tool. It focuses more on adjusting the file descriptor limit. However, using a dependency management tool, such as Maven, can help manage project dependencies and ensure the application is using compatible and optimized libraries.

2. Collaborating with a Sysadmin: Working with a seasoned Linux sysadmin is recommended to assess the system's needs, conduct performance testing, and determine the appropriate file descriptor limit based on the specific requirements of the application and the resources it accesses.

February 25, 2022

## Problem

1. Difficulty in selecting the right error handling tool: The article highlights the challenge of choosing the appropriate error handling tool from the available options. The history of error handling in C++ demonstrates that there is no perfect tool, and developers often have to wait for future versions to get better options.

2. Complexity and potential sources of incorrect behavior: Error handling introduces complexity to the code and can lead to potential sources of incorrect behavior. Writing code to handle errors adds complexity and makes it more difficult to understand the code, especially when developers primarily focus on the "happy path" of execution.

## Solution

1. Implement robust exception handling in your code to gracefully handle exceptions and recover from them when possible. This can involve using try-catch blocks to catch specific exceptions and handle them appropriately, providing meaningful error messages, and taking appropriate actions to prevent application termination.

2. Utilize the exception handling mechanism provided by the .NET framework, which offers consistent exception throwing and handling across different programming languages. This allows each language to define its own syntax for handling exceptions while ensuring compatibility within the .NET ecosystem.

3. Use exceptions as a superior method of error notification compared to traditional approaches like return codes. By throwing exceptions, failures are not ignored, and the runtime terminates the application if exceptions are unhandled. This helps identify and address issues more effectively, preventing the propagation of invalid values and ensuring program reliability.

## Decision Driver

How to Catch All Exceptions in C# & Find All Application Errors

## source type

Blog 

## author 

mwatson

## date

July 5, 2023

## Problem

1. Difficulty in finding and catching all exceptions: The article acknowledges that catching all exceptions in a software application can be challenging. It mentions the need to be aware of "First Chance Exceptions" and the .NET Framework's event mechanism to subscribe to exceptions. However, it also points out that logging every exception can result in a significant amount of noise and data, making it impractical for long-term use in a production application.

2. Limited coverage of exception handling in specific frameworks: The article discusses exception handling in ASP.NET, MVC, Web API, and WCF, but highlights that not all exceptions may bubble up to the Global.asax error handler in these frameworks. Each framework may have its own error handling mechanisms, making it necessary to understand and configure exception handling for specific frameworks.

3. Lack of guidance on handling exceptions in different scenarios: While the article provides examples of basic exception handling using try-catch blocks and demonstrates the use of multiple catch blocks and finally blocks, it doesn't provide comprehensive guidance on handling exceptions in different scenarios. It doesn't cover strategies for handling specific types of exceptions or best practices for error handling in different application contexts.

4. Potential performance and application behavior issues: The article mentions that subscribing to all exceptions and logging them can introduce noise and data, which may impact performance and cause inconvenience in application behavior. It advises caution in enabling such extensive exception logging in production applications.



## Solution

1. Improved exception tracking and logging: To address the difficulty in finding and catching all exceptions, developers can enhance their exception tracking and logging mechanisms. They can leverage tools or frameworks that provide more comprehensive exception monitoring and reporting capabilities. By logging exceptions in a structured and centralized manner, developers can gain better insights into the occurrence and nature of exceptions, enabling them to identify and address issues more effectively.

2. Comprehensive exception handling strategies for specific frameworks: To overcome the limited coverage of exception handling in specific frameworks, developers should invest time in understanding the error handling mechanisms and best practices specific to the frameworks they are using. This includes exploring exception filters, exception loggers, and exception handlers provided by the frameworks. By leveraging these features, developers can implement robust and customized exception handling strategies that cover a wide range of scenarios.

3. Context-specific exception handling approaches: Developers should explore context-specific exception handling approaches based on the nature of their application and the types of exceptions they expect to encounter. This involves identifying common exception scenarios and designing appropriate error handling strategies for each scenario. By considering factors such as user experience, application stability, and data integrity, developers can implement targeted exception handling techniques that align with the requirements of their application.

4. Balancing exception logging with performance considerations: While it is important to log exceptions for debugging and troubleshooting purposes, developers should strike a balance between comprehensive logging and application performance. Instead of enabling extensive exception logging in production environments, developers can implement exception logging selectively for specific scenarios or critical sections of the code. By focusing on capturing essential information about exceptions and avoiding unnecessary logging, developers can minimize performance impacts while still gaining valuable insights into application errors.
 
## Decision Driver

empower developers to improve the reliability and stability of their applications by effectively handling exceptions and minimizing the impact of errors on the end users.

## Problem

1. Difficulty in handling exceptions in WCF: Exception handling in WCF can be challenging due to the constraints of sending serialized data (SOAP messages) and the limited options for transmitting exception messages to the service consumers.

2. Lack of user-friendly exception messages: By default, when an exception occurs in a WCF service, the consumer receives a generic error message that does not provide detailed information about the actual error. This makes it difficult for consumers to understand and address the issue.


## Solution

1. Setting includeExceptionDetailInFaults to true: By configuring the includeExceptionDetailInFaults property in the web.config file or programmatically, developers can include additional details of the exception in the fault message sent to the consumer. This allows for more convenient debugging and understanding of the error.

2. Using FaultException: Instead of throwing a general Exception, developers can throw a FaultException with a specific error message. This allows for the transmission of user-friendly exception messages from the service to the consumers. Additionally, developers can create a custom fault class marked with the DataContract attribute to include more specific fault information.
 
## Decision Driver

้handle exceptions effectively in WCF applications to ensure proper error handling, enhance debugging capabilities, and provide user-friendly exception messages to the service consumers.

## Problem

1. Lack of exception handling in SQL Server: The article identifies the problem of not handling exceptions in SQL Server procedures. Without proper exception handling, it can be challenging to identify and resolve exceptions efficiently.

2. Difficulty in identifying the cause of exceptions: When exceptions occur in SQL Server procedures, it can be difficult to determine the root cause of the exception without proper logging or capturing of error details.

3. Inefficient debugging process: Without capturing and logging exception details, developers may waste significant time trying to locate the specific procedure or line causing the exception, leading to an inefficient debugging process.

4. Limited visibility and understanding of exceptions: Without a mechanism to log and capture exceptions, it becomes challenging to gain visibility and a comprehensive understanding of the exceptions occurring in the database.

## Solution

1. Implement try-catch blocks: The article suggests using try-catch blocks in SQL Server procedures to handle exceptions. This allows developers to catch exceptions and perform specific actions, such as logging or handling the exceptions gracefully.

2. Create an error log table: By creating a table specifically designed to capture DB-level errors, such as the "DBErrorLogs" table mentioned in the article, developers can log and store relevant information about the exceptions, including error number, state, severity, line number, procedure, message, and occurrence timestamp.

3. Use predefined SQL functions: The article highlights the usage of predefined SQL functions, such as ERROR_NUMBER(), ERROR_STATE(), ERROR_SEVERITY(), ERROR_LINE(), ERROR_PROCEDURE(), ERROR_MESSAGE(), and GETDATE(), to capture specific details of the exception. These functions provide valuable information to identify the root cause of the exception.

4. Improve debugging process: By logging exception details in the error log table, developers can easily refer to the captured information to identify the cause of the exception. This streamlines the debugging process and allows for more efficient resolution of exceptions.
 
## Decision Driver

revolves around improving the exception handling process in SQL Server, facilitating better debugging, and enabling developers to address exceptions effectively.

## Problem

1. Large-Scale Software Complexity: Large-scale software projects are too complex to be bug-free, and it's impossible to test for all the different ways users will interact with the application. Users can uncover bugs that were not caught during testing or were not anticipated by the development team
   
2. Limited User Error Reporting: Relying on users to report errors by clicking on "Send Error Report" popups is ineffective. Users often don't submit error reports, resulting in a lack of confidence and feedback in the error reporting process

## Solution

1. Architecting for Better Error Reporting: To address the challenges of large-scale software, it is recommended to architect software for better error reporting. This includes establishing naming conventions, including version information, identifying associated features or unit tests, and creating clear standards for exception handling across the organization. By doing so, errors and exceptions can be quickly understood and addressed.
   
2. Utilizing an Error Monitoring Platform: Instead of relying solely on user-reported errors, it is crucial to proactively monitor and track errors and exceptions. Using an error monitoring platform, such as Raygun's Crash Reporting, can centralize error logs and provide insights into error trends over time. This allows prioritization of fixing errors that impact user experience, prioritize production server issues, and identify sudden increases in specific errors after deployments.
