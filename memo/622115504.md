## problems:
1. Viruses strike.
2. Servers overheat.
3. Computer components wear out.
4. Power outage.

## Solutions:

1. Stay operational. Make sure your system doesn't go down altogether when something breaks. 

2. Reduce risks. Bar disruptions stemming from one critical piece of hardware or software. Overlap functions, so you can share the load in a crisis. 

3. Buy time. Fixing any kind of IT problem requires investigation and savvy. Fault tolerance ensures people can keep working while you hunt down the source.
## Decision Driver:

The need to ensure a computer program's stability and proper functioning despite encountering exceptions or unexpected events.

## problems:

1. The divideNumbers method takes two integers as input and checks if the divisor is zero. If the divisor is zero, it throws an ArithmeticException with the message "Cannot divide the given number by zero!"

## Solutions:

1. In the main method, we call the divideNumbers method with 10 as the dividend and 0 as the divisor. Since the divisor is zero, it throws an exception. Using a try-catch block, we catch the exception and print the error message "Error: Cannot divide by zero".

## problems:

1. In the example, we are trying to divide a number by 0. Here, this code generates an exception.

## Solutions:

1. To handle the exception, we have put the code, 5 / 0 inside the try block. Now when an exception occurs, the rest of the code inside the try block is skipped.
2. We are dividing a number by 0 inside the try block. Here, this code generates an ArithmeticException.

## problems:

1. After printing the third line, the code initializes an array with three integers, and pass it as an argument to a private method. The method tries to print the fourth item in the array, which doesn’t exist. This causes the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException exception to be thrown.

## Solutions:

1. The flow control of the program is then handed to the catch block. Inside the catch block, the code just prints a message explaining that the array doesn’t have four items. Then, execution is resumed.

## problems:

1. Division by zero: Print "Invalid division".
2. String parsed to a numeric variable : Print "Format mismatch".
3. Accessing an invalid index in string : Print "Index is invalid".
4. Accessing an invalid index in array : Print "Array index is invalid".

## Solutions:

1.  This is a user defined Exception which you need to create. It takes a parameter . When an exception of this class is encountered, the handler should print "MyException[param]", here param is the parameter passed to the exception class.
## Decision Driver:

-provide comprehensive information and guidelines on exception handling in the Java programming language.

## problems:

1. Program for chained exception

## Solutions:

1. Exception helps to identify a situation in which one exception causes another Exception in an application.For instance, consider a method which throws an ArithmeticException because of an attempt to divide by zero but the actual cause of exception was an I/O error which caused the divisor to be zero.
