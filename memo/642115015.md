## problem

1. Lack of focus on software fault tolerance in Realtime systems
2. Data inconsistency in distributed Realtime systems
3. Handling software exceptions and errors in Realtime systems

## Solution

1. Implementing timeouts can help limit the impact of software errors on system performance.
2. Implementing auditing can help maintain data consistency between processors in real-time systems. Auditing periodically checks the consistency of data structures by performing predefined checks.
3. Real-time systems should include exception handling mechanisms to recover from failures and errors. When a task receives a message, it should perform mitigation checks to ensure consistency between the message and the task's internal state.

## Decision Driver

- guide the selection and implementation of software fault tolerance techniques to improve system performance, availability, and reliability.

## problem

1.Flawed Exception Handling: The current exception handling mechanism in modern programming languages, such as C#, Java, and Python
2.Decreased Software Quality: Improper exception handling practices result in decreased software quality and dependability. Lack of proper error handling and recovery mechanisms leads to code vulnerabilities and potential application failures.
3.Productivity Impairment: Programmers face productivity issues when they try to provide proper exception handling. Writing catch blocks and thinking about error handling code can significantly impair productivity and code development speed.
4.Programmer Intervention: Exception handling requires explicit intervention from the programmer, including writing catch blocks and handling specific exceptions. This tight coupling of exception handling with business code increases the complexity and potential for errors.
5.Lack of Recovery Strategies: Existing exception handling approaches lack support for recovery strategies. Developers often need to manually write acceptance tests and state cleaning procedures, which are challenging tasks, especially for generic code.

## Solution

1.Runtime-Level Exception Handling: Exception handling should become a platform-level issue, either at the runtime or operating system level. The execution environment should provide mechanisms for automatically handling and recovering from exceptions without explicit intervention from the programmer.
2.Automatic Recovery: Virtual machines or operating systems should include a "garbage collector" for exception handling. Most common exceptions should be automatically handled and recovered if they occur, reducing the need for explicit catch blocks and manual recovery code.
3.Simplified Exception Handling: Programmers should mark blocks of code with a simple try {...} construct to indicate potential exceptions. The burden of writing catch blocks for common exceptions should be alleviated, allowing developers to focus more on business logic.
4.Resumable Exceptions and Transactional System: Resumable exceptions should be supported, allowing try blocks to be retried multiple times while trying different recovery strategies. A "mini-transactional system" can ensure that try blocks start from the same state during multiple retries, enabling efficient recovery attempts.
5.Incorporating Recovery Blocks: The use of recovery blocks, combined with exception handling, can provide an effective mechanism for error detection and recovery. Contextual information about the cause of the fault should be available within recovery blocks, enabling appropriate recovery actions to be taken.


## Decision Driver

- The decision to shift exception handling to the platform level and introduce automatic recovery mechanisms is driven by the goal of improving software quality, increasing productivity, and reducing the burden on programmers. It is based on the recognition of flaws in the current approach and drawing parallels with successful memory management techniques.

## problem

1.Vulnerability of Single Version Systems: When a software system is one single block of code, it becomes more vulnerable to failure. A single error in the program can bring down the entire system.
2.Undetected Errors: Faults in software systems often occur due to gaps left unnoticed during the design phase. Without proper error detection mechanisms, these errors can go undetected, leading to system failures.
3.Disruption in Normal Flow: Errors in the normal functional flow of a software system can disrupt the execution and result in failures. Without appropriate exception handling techniques, it becomes challenging to redirect the execution flow towards recovery.
4.Run-time Exceptions: Run-time exceptions, which occur during the execution of a software program, can lead to complete failure if not addressed properly. There is a need for techniques to handle such exceptions and ensure the system can recover and continue functioning.
5.Identifying Faulty Areas: It is important to identify faulty areas in software systems to improve fault tolerance. Without effective techniques, it can be difficult to capture and address these areas.

## Solution

1.Modular Software Structure: Structuring the software system in a modular form can improve fault tolerance. By dividing the system into separate modules, each module can have specific instructions on how to handle failures, allowing other modules to continue running smoothly.
2.Error Detection Mechanisms: Implementing error detection mechanisms helps in identifying and locating errors within the system. This can be achieved through self-protection and self-checking attributes, enabling the system to spot errors in both external and internal modules.
3.Exception Handling: Exception handling techniques redirect the execution flow towards recovery when errors occur in the normal functional flow. Different types of exceptions, such as interface exceptions, local exceptions, and failure exceptions, can be handled to ensure system stability.
4.Checkpoint and Restart: The checkpoint and restart technique allows the system to recover from run-time exceptions. By placing checkpoints in the program, it is possible to restart the program immediately from the occurrence of the error, ensuring no record of the error is left behind.
5.Process Pairs and Data Diversity: Using process pairs and data diversity techniques can help identify faulty areas in the software system. Process pairs involve running the same software on different hardware units to validate functional differences, while data diversity involves passing a set of input data with checkpoints for detecting errors.

## problem

1. Intermixing program logic with error-checking code can make programs hard to read and debug.
2. Many potential problems occur infrequently, making conventional error-checking cumbersome.
3. When multiple programmers and modules are involved, setting up uniform error-handling techniques can be challenging.

## Solution

1. Use exception handling to separate error-checking code from the main tasks of the program, improving clarity and modifiability.
2. Utilize exception handling for handling infrequent error situations that don't need to be handled in the same block where they occur, improving the program's fault tolerance.
3. Implement exception handling to establish standardized error-handling methods, making it easier to handle errors consistently across different modules and among multiple programmers.


## Decision Driver

- The decision driver from the article is the need to improve the clarity, modifiability, and fault tolerance of programs by separating error-checking code from the main tasks of the program.

Practical exception handling and resolution in concurrent programs

## source type

Article

## author 

Elsevier Ltd.

## date

April 1997

## problem

1. Lack of support for concurrent exception handling and resolution in standard conventional languages (Ada and Ada 95).
2. The need for a simplified atomic action support and self-checking programming to handle failures and resolve exceptions effectively.

## Solution

1. The paper proposes a scheme to program atomic actions based on forward error recovery within Ada and Ada 95. It introduces templates and programmers' conventions that enable the implementation of atomic actions in these languages. This scheme allows programmers to use any resolution procedure, making it flexible.
2.  The paper introduces the concept of self-checking programming, which simplifies the atomic action support by allowing the necessary failure assumptions. It discusses how this approach can be applied to Ada, particularly in the context of implementing resolution procedures. By incorporating self-checking programming, the paper presents a solution to the deserter process problem and outlines potential improvements when using Ada 95.

## Decision Driver

- to address the common mistakes in event-driven systems and provide solutions to overcome these pitfalls.
