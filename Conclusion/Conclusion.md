# Problem02 : Exception Handling (S02, S04, S05, S06, S07, S19, S26, S29, S37)

## Solution1 : In the main method, we call the divideNumbers method with 10 as the dividend and 0 as the divisor. Since the divisor is zero, it throws an exception. Using a try-catch block, we catch the exception and print the error message "Error: Cannot divide by zero" (S02)

## Solution2 : To handle the exception, we have put the code, 5 / 0 inside the try block. Now when an exception occurs, the rest of the code inside the try block is skipped (S04)

## Solution3 : The flow control of the program is then handed to the catch block. Inside the catch block, the code just prints a message explaining that the array doesn’t have four items. Then, execution is resumed (S05)

## Solution4 : This is a user defined Exception which you need to create. It takes a parameter . When an exception of this class is encountered, the handler should print "MyException[param]", here param is the parameter passed to the exception class (S06)

## Solution5 : Exception helps to identify a situation in which one exception causes another Exception in an application.For instance, consider a method which throws an ArithmeticException because of an attempt to divide by zero but the actual cause of exception was an I/O error which caused the divisor to be zero (S07)

## Solution6 : Using FaultException: Instead of throwing a general Exception, developers can throw a FaultException with a specific error message. This allows for the transmission of user-friendly exception messages from the service to the consumers. Additionally, developers can create a custom fault class marked with the DataContract attribute to include more specific fault information (S19)

## Solution7 : Use exception handling to separate error-checking code from the main tasks of the program, improving clarity and modifiability (S26)

## Solution8 : Catch blocks are used to handle specific types of exceptions (S29)

## Solution9 : Ensure proper propagation of exceptions by catching and rethrowing them or handling them at appropriate levels (S37)

# Problem03 : Error Handling (S20, S31, S36, S37, S40, S41, S42)
Create an error log table: By creating a table specifically designed to capture DB-level errors, such as the "DBErrorLogs" table mentioned in the article, developers can log and store relevant information about the exceptions, including error number, state, severity, line number, procedure, message, and occurrence timestamp.
Exceptions can occur almost anywhere. Most of the time, the biggest problem for people who are new to RxJava is the lack of onError callback implementation.
Establish and follow consistent error handling practices throughout the codebase.
Ensure proper propagation of exceptions by catching and rethrowing them or handling them at appropriate levels.

# Problem05 : Making Exception Handling Work (s23)
## Solution
Runtime-Level Exception Handling: Exception handling should become a platform-level issue, either at the runtime or operating system level. The execution environment should provide mechanisms for automatically handling and recovering from exceptions without explicit intervention from the programmer.
## Decision Driver
- The decision to shift exception handling to the platform level and introduce automatic recovery mechanisms is driven by the goal of improving software quality, increasing productivity, and reducing the burden on programmers. It is based on the recognition of flaws in the current approach and drawing parallels with successful memory management techniques.
