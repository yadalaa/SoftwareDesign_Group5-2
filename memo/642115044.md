What is exception handling?

## problem

1. Exception handling differs from error handling in that the former involves conditions an application might catch versus serious problems an application might want to avoid. In contrast, error handling helps maintain the normal flow of software program execution.

2. Exceptions occurring during program execution can disrupt the normal operation.

3. invalid user input, coding errors

## Solution

1. Error logging, displaying error messages, and recovery actions can be performed in catch blocks.
2. Catch blocks are used to handle specific types of exceptions.


## Decision Driver

- share knowledge, Tells how to use try catch and can be used to write real code.

## problem

1. The program that we have written, when it is running, it suddenly bounces and closes the program.
2. Found strange messages all over the screen and the program crashed.
3. Need sample code Exception handler.

## Solution

1. Because your code has a bug Therefore, it must be used Exception handler.
2. have to use Exception handler.
3. try and catch (Exception e)


## Decision Driver

- share knowledge and Know Code Examples to use it.

## problem

1. Where is exceptions?
2. What if we forget to use a try-catch inside create and let create throw an exception?


## Solution

1. Exceptions can occur almost anywhere. Most of the time, the biggest problem for people who are new to RxJava is the lack of onError callback implementation.
2. Wrapped with try-catch and non-wrapped with try-catch are equal, RxJava handles this for us, so using subscriber.onError() will make error handling in RxJava much easier. if we use.


## Decision Driver

-  address the concerns and potential issues related to exception handling in RxJava. and write about using onError callback.

## problem

1. Why are we thinking exception
2. Why are we thinking error codes
3. would the answer change if we were talking to managed clients instead of native clients?

## Solution

1. it would make server side code a lot more uniform
2. because we think it makes more sense from the client side perspective.
3. Just to add a bit of clarification: a: I am looking for best practices here and experience from the client side (since the client is lot more complicated and we would rather handle stuff at server side if we can keep client code simpler) b: The client contains a lot of legacy code and we may or may not be able to use C++ exceptions.


## Decision Driver

- handling exceptions and error codes in server-side code, considering the impact on client-side complexity and taking into account the perspective of managed clients versus native clients.

## problem

1. Acknowledgement pattern
2. prevent a network or components failure from flowing to other components?
3. How to mask errors in a system so as to avoid system failure. Some applications

## Solution

1. The idea is to detect errors in a system by acknowledging the reception of input within a specified time interval.
2. The solution to the above problem proposed by the ‘Circuit Breaker’ pattern is based
3. We will use a set of processors which receive the same input and delivery order and conduct processing on their inputs independently and simultaneously.

## Decision Driver

- deal with system errors and failures

 4 PROBLEMS WITH JAVA’S EXCEPTIONS AND HOW SCALA CAN HELP

## author

## problem

1. Exceptions are easy to miss

2. Exception control flow is hard to follow

3. Normal events are treated as exceptional

4. Exceptions are runtime, not compile-time, errors

## Solution

1. removing the error from the normal path of data by wrapping it in an exception adds an unnecessary level of complexity, making the overall result of a code path harder to predict.
2. Rather than following the usual flow of data through parameters and return values, Java’s exceptions occur outside the normal function pattern, resulting in confusing and fragile code.
3. if user not following guidelines becomes an exceptional case and the function caller is responsible for remembering to handle the exception.

## Decision Driver

- predictability, readability, and maintainability of the code.

## problem

1. Do not use bare except

2. why raise Exception is not good.


## Solution

1. I made you to get more bug. and use many time to process
2. you should always plan and figure out what can break and what exceptions are expected to be thrown.


## Decision Driver

- The design code must be as clear and efficient as possible.
